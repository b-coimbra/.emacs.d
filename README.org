* Preview

  The entire config file can be viewed from [[https://emacs.metaphoric.dev][here]] in HTML format.

* Installation

  Clone this repo into your *.emacs.d*:

  #+begin_src sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/b-coimbra/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d --recurse-submodules
  #+end_src

** Font

   The font currently set in the config is [[https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka][Iosevka]].

   To install the ligatures, the [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues/211#issuecomment-239058632][FiraCode Regular Symbol]] font is needed.

** Icons

   If you care about fancy icons, install the fonts provided by [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all the icons]]:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
   #+end_src

** Syntax checking/linting

   Most IDE-like features are provided by the [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][LSP]] package. For it to work properly, you need to install the appropriate [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#supported-languages][language servers]].

** Themes

   ~SPC T s~ to cycle through the available themes.

** Customization

   Create a =userconfig.org= file in the =.emacs.d= directory and add your custom settings there (in "emacs-lisp" org-mode code blocks).

   You may also edit the =config.org= file directly, but your custom settings might be wiped out in case of an update.

** Keybindings

   Keybindings defined by =general.el=
